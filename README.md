A state-space implementation of Pad&eacute; approximation of time delays.

See my article [Pad&eacute; Delay is Okay Today](https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/927.php)
for some context and example usage.

**NOTE:** This is a [Mercurial repository](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/). If you are accessing it
via any of the Git hosting services, it is through [hg-git](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/HgGit),
and I make no claims that the Git view of the repository is reliable.
Atlassian bought the Mercurial hosting service Bitbucket in September 2010, adding Git support within
the next few years and letting the Mercurial support wither and die, finally pulling the life-support
plug in summer 2020. I had been hosting this repository on bitbucket.org at the time. So long,
and thanks for all the fish.
